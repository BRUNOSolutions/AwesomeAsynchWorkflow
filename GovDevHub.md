The [GovInfo Developer Hub](https://www.govinfo.gov/developers) is all aobut making it easier for developers and the public at large to access and work with the information available on GovInfo. The [Govt Publishing Office uses GitHub](https://github.com/usgpo) to provide documentation to the developer community about our content, metadata, and processes used to generate it. Additionally, GPO's GitHub repositories help users retrieve GovInfo content and metadata programatically or in bulk, including supporting resources and user guides. Data users can also submit and track feedback on GPO's GitHub repositories.

### Sitemaps

[US Govt Printing Office](https://github.com/usgpo) maintains [sitemaps](https://github.com/usgpo/sitemap) for [US Govt Info developers](https://www.govinfo.gov/developers). These sitemaps are functionally similar to the existing [GovInfo Interactive Link Discovery Service](https://www.govinfo.gov/) though the structure has been streamlined to make it easier to track updates to specific collections ... findability of govinfo far from trivial ... but there system allows for both predictable link creation as well as the ability to point to the latest version of a given resource - like the latest version of a Congressional Bill or latest edition of a CFR section. The [GovInfo sitemap](https://github.com/usgpo/sitemap) indices and sitemaps follow a standard XML sitemap protocol to allow external developers and systems, such as internet search engines, more easily discover and access GovInfo content.
